# Release v0.11.0

This release brings with it a huge update. First, and formost,
v1beta1 support has been added to CRDs. This will now successfully
generate values for `Validate` entities that don't have any versions
listed.

Another huge update is to the frontend. The frontend contains now a
textare that can be edited and the content will be generated on the fly
instead of having to send the content to be rendered.

And lastley, the whole repo has a test now that uses the created
test suite to make sure that all rendering is still working after
an update.
