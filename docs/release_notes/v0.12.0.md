# Release v0.12.0

:boom: _**WARNING**_! This release contains a breaking change. :boom:

I restructured the CLI api. Now, generate is a top level command. It has
TWO subcommands called `crd` and `scheme`. Pull request number [#119](https://github.com/Skarlso/crd-to-sample-yaml/pull/119)
introduced a new feature where you are now able to generate a JSON schema
from a CRD. This is useful for auto-generating completion schemas and further
tooling support that uses raw JSON schemas.
