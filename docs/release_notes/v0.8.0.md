# v0.8.0

## MAJOR UPDATE

### Changes to how values are generated

This update contains a few modifications to the way we generate samples. These modifications are the following:

- if enum values are defined for a property, choose the first one from the list whatever that is
- if there is a minimum defined for integer types, the minimum value is used
- comment is added to list items of what type they are and how much the minimum value for them is
```yaml
volumeIDs: [] # minItems 0 of type string
```
- unless `no-random` is defined, now given a `Pattern` that contains a valid regex a valid value is generated that satisfies the regex
  and the regex's value is commented after the value
```yaml
name: xwjhylgy2ruc # ^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9.-]{1,61}[a-z0-9]$
```

The random generation can be skipped by providing the following flag to `cty`: `--no-random`.

### New `test` command

A new command has been added that lets users unit test schema validation for generated YAML files to CRDs.

To read more about it, check out the readme: `crd-testing-README.md`.
