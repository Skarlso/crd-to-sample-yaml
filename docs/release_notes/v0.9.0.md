# v0.9.0

This update brings with it some version upgrades and changes how
required fields are calculated for minimum samples. That is
samples that satisfy the minimum required fields present in a CRD.

It will render fields better.

Also fixed a problem where `{}` would not be rendered in case
a top level object was required but didn't had any more required
fields it self. In that case, it would be rendered as `field:` and
that's it. Which made the schema fail.

Now, a `{}` is correctly put after it if it's an object. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Whatever
spec:
  fields: {}
```
