# Release v1.0.0

:boom: _**BREAKING CHANGE**_ :boom:

This is the first official 1.0.0 version of CRD sample. This tool has come a long way
from simply generating sample YAML files from CRDs. It now supports the following
major features:

- CRD testing
- Generating JSON schemas
- Validating more types other than CRD that support openAPIV3schema section in their `spec` field
- Generating minimum required yamls
- Adding comments
- Generating YAML that 100% conforms to the given schema, respecting minimum values, regex, formats, etc.
- A feature rich website with
  - live code changes rendering
  - back navigation
  - lots of tiny options

This has been quite the journey. Hopefully, from now on, the API will be somewhat stable. I can't promise completey
unbreakable changes, but I promise not to break anything in Patch versions.
