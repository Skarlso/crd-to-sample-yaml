# Release v1.1.0

- feat: add option to generate Details section on the spot #153

This feature introduced an overhaul of the frontend and the Generation
logic. Previously, the required only generation was destructive to the
object. Meaning it actually removed fields that weren't required from the
schema object as it was going through it.

This has been revised. Now, this process is non-destructive. So it can be
called multiple times on the same object. This was introduced so the frontend
now has a switch where it can on-the-fly generate the output based on the
settings provided in the details view.
