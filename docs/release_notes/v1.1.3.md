# Release v1.1.3

- feat: ignore errors in matchers and add format byte

The CRD tester now can ignore certain errors. For example:

```yaml
suite: test ClusterSecretStore
template: tests/crds/clustersecretstore.yml
tests:
  - it: matches ClusterSecretStore correctly
    asserts:
      - matchSnapshot:
          path: tests/__snapshot__
          # We deliberately want to test all the included elements.
          ignoreErrors:
            - "in body should have at most 1 properties"
```
